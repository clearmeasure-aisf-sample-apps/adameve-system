.SYNOPSIS
    Commits the nodes an application with its own runtime reported to environments/<env>/nodes.json on main.

.DESCRIPTION
    Steps "Record nodes" and "Record nodes after revert" of the Octopus project <slug>-<deployable> whose deployable
    brings its own runtime (system.json hosting "own"); octopus/projects.tf inlines this file for both. "Record
    nodes" stands right after "Verify deployable" and runs only when that step succeeded.

    "Record nodes after revert" stands right after "Verify revert" and runs only when the deployment has failed. A
    failed deployment goes back to the version before with the deploy.ps1 of the release that failed, which may
    have changed what the application runs on (a region more, another address). When "Verify revert" found that the
    version before runs again and its verify.ps1 reported nodes, this step records them, so that the record says
    what runs (principle 002). It reads the output variables of "Verify revert" instead of those of "Verify
    deployable", and names the version before in its commit ("Pin version" recorded it). When "Verify revert" did
    not pass, or nothing was put back, there is no report: the record stays as it is.

    Why a step of its own. "Verify deployable" runs the application's verify.ps1 (scripts/invoke-application.ps1),
    and a step that runs code from an application's repository does not receive the credential that writes to main
    of the system repository: the stored GitHub.Token, or the key of the system's own GitHub App
    (octopus/variables.tf, token_steps). This step receives it and runs nothing of the application's: it has no
    package, and it starts no script. The functions that make its token (scripts/github-token.ps1) are part of
    this step's own script body: octopus/projects.tf joins that file and this one when Terraform plans, so no text
    is run here that a step could have set. All it takes from the step before is text, the output
    variables NodesReported and Nodes of "Verify deployable": what verify.ps1 wrote to its nodesFile, unread. That
    text is the application's and is treated as such: it is parsed as JSON, checked against the rules below, and
    only the known fields, with the types the rules name, are written, under the name of this project's deployable,
    in the file of this deployment's environment. A text can keep the record from being written, or record nodes
    the application does not have; it decides nothing else of what is committed.

    The limits are this step's own. "Verify deployable" hands on no file larger than 256 KB, but it is the step that
    runs the application's code, and a script may be able to write the service message that sets an output variable
    itself: nothing that step says is relied on here. Before the text is parsed it must be at most 64 KB (UTF-8).
    Parsed, it holds at most 100 nodes, and every field has its length and its characters (ConvertTo-NodeRecord
    below). 100 nodes of the longest values allowed are under 64 KB. The two variables are content to check and
    nothing else: a text is checked whatever NodesReported says.

    The rules (the contract is in the header of scripts/invoke-application.ps1). One JSON object with the field
    names of a deployable in the dashboard's topology:
      nodes         required: a list of at least one node, each { "url": an https address with a public host name,
                    each once; optional "name", "region" and "role" (primary or standby) }
      frontDoor     optional (or null): an https address with a public host name
      healthPath, alivePath, versionPath   optional: paths that start with /
      healthReport  optional: true or false (false: the hourly Health report does not ask these nodes)
    Each field has an allow-list (ConvertTo-NodeRecord below says which characters and how long), and a value
    outside it makes the report invalid: nothing is stripped or repaired.
    The record is committed as { "<deployable>": { ... } } next to the other deployables' entries, keys in order,
    through the contents API, as the system's own GitHub App or with the stored GitHub.Token of a system without one
    (scripts/github-token.ps1), the way "Pin version" commits versions.json (scripts/pin-version.ps1: read, compare,
    write, again after a 409). A record that is already the same is not committed again (a
    redeployment). No report: the step succeeds, says that the application reported no nodes, and leaves the record
    as it is. The dashboard's deployment (scripts/deploy-staticwebapp.ps1) reads the record; the system workflow
    ignores a push that changes only nodes.json.

    A record that cannot be written does not fail the deployment. This step runs after "Verify deployable" passed:
    the version runs and answers, and taking a healthy deployment back ("Revert deployable", "Revert pin") because
    its nodes could not be written down would put a worse state in place of a better one. So the step ends
    successfully with ONE warning line that says what was not recorded, why, and what follows: for a report that
    breaks a rule or a limit (every problem named), for a nodes.json on main that is not a JSON object, for GitHub
    not answering after the retries of a known transient failure (no answer, 408, 429, 5xx: four attempts), for a
    file that changed at each of four attempts to write it, for a request GitHub refuses, for an error of this
    script, and for GitHub not giving the App its token after the same four attempts (no answer, 408, 429, 5xx). Octopus then shows the deployment as succeeded with warnings, which the kit's test-deployment-logs.ps1
    and the fleet's log finding report; the dashboard keeps the nodes of the last record meanwhile.
    What stays a failure is a system that does not work, not a record that could not be written: the credential did
    not reach the step (GitHub.Token, or the App's key: the scope of the variable leaves the step out); the App is
    configured in part; or GitHub refuses the App a token for a reason that does not pass by itself (401: the key is
    not the App's; 403; 404: the installation is gone; 422: the installation does not cover the repository or lacks
    the permission; a key that is no key). The next deployment would fail at "Pin version" for the same reason.
